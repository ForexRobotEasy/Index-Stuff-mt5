### How It Works
The Expert Advisor continuously evaluates the market price against the 14-period simple moving average (SMA). When the bid price is above the SMA, the EA places a buy order. Conversely, when the ask price is below the SMA, the EA places a sell order.

The risk level of the trade can be adjusted by the user via the `RiskLevel` input parameter.

### Initialization
The Expert Advisor is initialized via the `OnInit()` function, which is called once when the EA starts running. This function initializes the variables needed for the EA to run.

### Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit()` function is called once when the EA stops running. This function cleans up any resources used by the EA.

### Tick Function
The `OnTick()` function is called on every new tick. This is where the main logic of the EA is implemented.
